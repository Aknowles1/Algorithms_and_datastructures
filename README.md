## Overview
This project serves as a collection of fundamental algorithms and data structures implemented in Python. The focus is on understanding the underlying concepts, improving problem-solving skills, and writing efficient code. The repository will be regularly updated as new topics are covered throughout the course.

## Algorithms
The following algorithms will be implemented as part of this project:

- **A\* Search Algorithm**
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Binary Search
- Dynamic Programming (e.g., Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence)
  
*More algorithms will be added as the course progresses.*

## Data Structures
The following data structures will be implemented:

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly)
- Stack
- Queue
- Hash Map
- Graphs
- Heaps
- Trie

## Installation
To run the algorithms and data structure implementations locally, you'll need to have Python installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorithms-data-structures.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd algorithms-data-structures
    ```

3. It's recommended to create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # For Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. Install the required dependencies (if any):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
Each algorithm or data structure will have its own Python script or Jupyter notebook that demonstrates its functionality.

To run a specific algorithm:
```bash
python algorithms/astar.py
